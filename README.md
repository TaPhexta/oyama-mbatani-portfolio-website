# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with **React**, **Vite**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. The application follows a component-based architecture with reusable UI components and a data-driven approach using JSON files to separate content from presentation.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my web development projects, technical skills, professional experience, education, and certifications while demonstrating modern React development practices.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture where each page is composed of reusable UI components.

```
Home
│
├── Hero
├── About Preview
├── Featured Projects
├── Skills
├── Experience Preview
└── Contact CTA
```

Content is stored inside JSON files, allowing the interface to update without changing component logic.

---

## Data-Driven Design

Application data is separated into dedicated JSON files.

* personal.json
* projects.json
* experience.json
* skills.json
* education.json
* certifications.json
* socials.json
* navigation.json
* site.json

Components consume this data through mapping instead of hardcoding content, making the application scalable and easier to maintain.
